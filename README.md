# Coffee Machine Simulator

This is a REPL (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) console application that simulates a Coffee Machine. The simulator allows users to manage the Coffee Machine's operations, including making coffee, adding ingredients, taking money, and more.

## Features

The Coffee Machine Simulator has the following features:

- **Ingredient Management**: The Coffee Machine can hold infinite amounts of ingredients such as water, milk, and coffee beans.

- **Money Box**: The Coffee Machine has a money box that stores the money collected from selling coffee.

- **Coffee Types**: Different types of coffee can be selected, each with its price and ingredient requirements:
  - **Espresso**:
    - Price: $4/cup
    - Ingredients: 250 ml of water, 0 ml of milk, 16 coffee beans per cup
  - **Latte**:
    - Price: $7/cup

- **Buy Option**: Users can buy a coffee of their choice, but the Coffee Machine dispenses coffee only if it contains enough ingredients. Otherwise, it shows an error message.

- **Refill Ingredients**: There is a "fill" option that allows users to add ingredients to the Coffee Machine as specified.

- **Take Money**: A "take" option enables the maintainer to withdraw money from the money box.

- **Show Ingredients**: Users can check the remaining ingredients in the Coffee Machine.

- **Exit**: There is an "exit" option that stops the simulation.
